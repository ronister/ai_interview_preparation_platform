Develop a program in Python which takes two inputs and returns the sum of their squares.,"5, 9","def sum_of_squares(num1, num2):
  return num1**2 + num2**2

x = 5
y = 9

print(sum_of_squares(x, y))
# output: 106"
Create a Python program to automatically delete any repeated words from a given text.,The cat was was running running in the park,"text = ""The cat was running in the park""

words = text.split(' ')
unique_words = []

for word in words:
 if word not in unique_words: 
  unique_words.append(word)

print(' '.join(unique_words))"
"Utilizing the list comprehension, create a python program that removes all multiples of 3 from the input list.","[3,4,6,8,9,12]","res = [x for x in [3,4,6,8,9,12] if x % 3 != 0] 
print(res)"
Write a Python program to detect cycle in a linked list using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm.,,"def detect_cycle(head): 
    slow_p = head 
    fast_p = head 
    while(slow_p and fast_p and fast_p.next) : 
        slow_p = slow_p.next
        fast_p = fast_p.next.next
        if slow_p == fast_p : 
            return True
    return False"
Model sentiment analysis task as a machine learning problem.,,"Create a Python program that can classify movie reviews or other texts as either positive or negative sentiment. The program should utilize a machine learning model, such as a recurrent neural network with a word-embedding layer, or a logistic regression with a bag-of-words vectorizer to classify the text. The model should be trained on a labeled dataset and be tested for accuracy on a held-out test set."
